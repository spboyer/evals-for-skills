### 2026-02-09: Proper git workflow required
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** All issues must follow: feature branch → commit → push → PR with `Closes #N` → @copilot review → address feedback → merge. No direct commits to main.
**Why:** User directive

### 2026-02-09: Sensei reference repo for E2 implementation
**By:** Squad (Coordinator)
**What:** The sensei engine (E2: #32-38) must adopt functionality from https://github.com/spboyer/sensei. Key patterns to port to Go:

**Scoring Algorithm:** Low (description < 150 chars OR no triggers) → Medium (description >= 150 chars AND trigger keywords) → Medium-High (USE FOR + DO NOT USE FOR) → High (Medium-High + routing clarity). Rule-based checks: name validation, description length, trigger/anti-trigger detection, routing clarity, MCP integration.

**Ralph Loop:** READ → SCORE → CHECK → SCAFFOLD → IMPROVE FRONTMATTER → IMPROVE TESTS → VERIFY → CHECK TOKENS → SUMMARY → PROMPT → REPEAT (max 5 iterations, target: Medium-High).

**Token Management:** count/check/suggest/compare with .token-limits.json config. SKILL.md: 500 soft / 5000 hard. References: 2000 each. --strict exits 1 on limit breach.
**Why:** User directive — spboyer/sensei is the reference implementation

### 2026-02-09: Monitor human engineer comments
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** Periodically check for comments from Charles (@chlowell) and Richard (@richardpark-msft) on open issues. Follow up on responses.
**Why:** User directive

### 2026-02-09: Run command test patterns
**By:** Linus (Backend Dev)
**Related:** #24
**What:** Each test that calls `cmd.Execute()` must reset package-level flag vars (`contextDir`, `outputPath`, `verbose`) at the top of the test body to prevent state leakage. If new flags are added to `newRunCommand()`, the reset block must be updated accordingly.
**Why:** Package-level Cobra flag bindings persist across test cases in the same process.

### 2026-02-11: PR #103 — azd extension packaging approved
**By:** Rusty (Lead)
**Related:** E7 (#62), PR #103
**What:** Wallace Breza's azd extension PR approved and merged. Adds `extension.yaml`, build scripts, `registry.json`, `version.txt`. Purely additive — no changes to existing Go code or CI. Follow-up: update registry URLs to `spboyer/waza` for production; add trailing newlines (POSIX nit); consider CI for automated extension builds.
**Why:** E7 (AZD Extension) P2 roadmap item — establishes foundation without disruption.

### 2026-02-11: Grader nil-session error handling contract
**By:** Rusty (Lead)
**Related:** PR #110
**What:** All graders depending on `SessionDigest` must return a zero-score `GraderResults` with `nil` error when session is nil — not `(nil, error)`. Matches `behavior_grader.go` pattern (lines 56-62). Returning an error would abort the entire run instead of gracefully recording a zero score.
**Why:** Runner distinguishes grader errors (may abort) from zero-score results (contribute to scoring). Affects `action_sequence_grader.go` and future session-dependent graders.

### 2026-02-11: PR #111 approved — tokens compare command
**By:** Rusty (Lead)
**What:** Approved Charles Lowell's `waza tokens compare` implementation. New `internal/git` package lives under `cmd/waza/tokens/internal/git/` — correctly scoped as a tokens-internal dependency. Command follows established Cobra factory patterns (`newCompareCmd()`). Closes #51 (E4: Token Management).
**Why:** Clean architecture, comprehensive tests, CI green. One non-blocking nit: `RefExists()` is dead code. No security concerns.

### 2026-02-12: azd-publish skill location convention
**By:** Wallace Breza (via Copilot)
**What:** The azd-publish skill is a repo-level skill (lives at `.github/skills/azd-publish/`), NOT part of the project eval skills under `skills/`. Repo-level automation skills go under `.github/skills/`, project eval skills go under `skills/`.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-12: azd extension uses non-standard tag pattern
**By:** Linus (Backend Dev)
**Related:** PR #113, E7
**What:** The azd extension release pipeline uses tags of the form `azd-ext-microsoft-azd-waza_VERSION` (e.g., `azd-ext-microsoft-azd-waza_0.2.0`), not `vVERSION`. Any tooling or documentation that references version tags for the azd extension must use this pattern. The SKILL.md comparison link examples have been updated accordingly.
**Why:** The `azd-publish` skill's Step 5 instructions referenced `vX.Y.Z` tags which don't match the actual tag convention, leading to broken comparison links in changelogs.

### 2026-02-12: PR #115 review feedback addressed
**By:** Linus (Backend Dev)
**Related:** PR #115, E7 (#62)
**What:** Rebased `feat/metadata-capability` onto latest `main` (797f72c), resolved `.golangci.yml` conflict (kept v2 format with `version: "2"` header), added doc comments on `metadataSchemaVersion` and `extensionID` constants per Rusty's review. All 4 metadata tests pass. Force-pushed to `wbreza/feat/metadata-capability`.
**Why:** PR had merge conflicts after main advanced; review requested clarifying comments on constants.
### 2026-02-11: Sensei dev command heuristics & test discipline
**By:** Rusty (Lead)
**Related:** E2 (#32-35), PR #117
**What:** `waza dev` heuristic scoring rules (from `spboyer/sensei` reference):
- **Low** — description < 150 chars OR no trigger phrases
- **Medium** — description ≥ 150 chars AND trigger keywords (USE FOR, USE THIS SKILL, TRIGGERS, etc.)
- **Medium-High** — Medium + anti-trigger phrases (DO NOT USE FOR, NOT FOR, Don't use, Instead use)
- **High** — Medium-High + routing clarity (INVOKES, FOR SINGLE OPERATIONS, **WORKFLOW SKILL**, **UTILITY SKILL**, **ANALYSIS SKILL**)

Test discipline: use table-driven subtests for pattern detection, validate against real fixture loading (code-explainer=Low, waza=High), test exact terminal output (box-drawing, emoji width awareness, rune counting), mock scorer interface for loop testing.
**Why:** Clear, testable compliance framework enables future skill compliance automation across the team's codebase. Reference implementation pattern reduces drift across similar tools.

### 2026-02-13: User directive — Review @copilot PRs with Opus 4.6
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** Always review @copilot PRs with Opus 4.6 before merging — double-check quality before auto-merge.
**Why:** User request — @copilot doc PRs need a quality gate

### 2026-02-14: User directive — Auto-assign unblocked work
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** Don't ask before assigning unblocked work to the squad or @copilot — just assign it and go.
**Why:** User request — reduces back-and-forth, keeps the pipeline moving

### 2026-02-14: User directive — Route doc updates to Saul after feature merges
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** After any feature PR merges that changes CLI commands, graders, eval YAML format, or examples, route a doc update task to Saul. Saul owns DEMO-GUIDE.md, GRADERS.md, TUTORIAL.md, examples/ READMEs, and the main README. Standing issue #148 tracks this.
**Why:** User wants documentation kept current automatically as features ship. Saul is the designated docs team member.

### 2026-02-14: User directive — Skills repo plugin bundle structure
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** The microsoft/skills repo is being reorganized from a flat `.github/skills/` layout (133 items) into plugin bundles (`.github/plugins/<bundle>/skills/<name>/`). Waza CI compatibility (#60) and any future skills integration must support both the current flat layout and the new nested plugin bundle layout. Key bundles: azure-skills (18 orchestration), azure-sdk-python (41), azure-sdk-dotnet (29), azure-sdk-typescript (24), azure-sdk-java (26), azure-sdk-rust (7), azure-core (6).
**Why:** User shared the distribution strategy gist (https://gist.github.com/spboyer/011190893f33d82d967180cdc5a2432d) — this is the planned future state and all CI work should be forward-compatible

### 2026-02-15: User directive — Don't take assigned work
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** Don't take anyone's work if it is assigned. Only pick up unassigned issues.
**Why:** User request

### 2026-02-15: User directive — Developer model policy
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** All developers (code-writing agents) must use claude-opus-4.6. If they are not, use this model for code review.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-15: Multi-model execution architecture
**By:** Linus (Backend Dev)
**Related:** #39 (E3), PR #152
**What:** When multiple `--model` flags are given, models are evaluated sequentially (not concurrently). Each model gets its own engine instance created fresh inside the loop. The `runSingleModel()` function encapsulates the full benchmark lifecycle for one model — config, engine, runner, execution, summary.
**Why:** Sequential execution is simpler, avoids resource contention between engines, and produces cleaner output (each model's progress prints in order). Parallel model execution can be added later as a separate flag if needed. The `modelResult` type and `printModelComparison()` function are ready for it — they operate on a collected slice regardless of execution order.

### 2026-02-15: Test failures in multi-model runs are non-fatal
**By:** Linus (Backend Dev)
**Related:** #39 (E3), PR #152
**What:** When running multiple models, a `TestFailureError` from one model doesn't abort the remaining models. The error is recorded and the last one is returned after all models complete. Infrastructure errors (load failure, unknown engine) still abort immediately.
**Why:** The whole point of comparison runs is to see how different models perform. Aborting on the first failure defeats the purpose. The user still gets a non-zero exit code if any model had failures.
